# Project Title:
@azure-database-migration505@

## Introduction
I embarked on this project on December 14, 2023, with the primary objective to demonstrate my capability in architecting and implementing a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure. This endeavor is a testament to my hands-on expertise in cloud engineering, beginning with the establishment of a production environment database. Following this, my focus will shift towards migrating the database to Azure SQL Database, showcasing the practical steps and methodologies involved in leveraging cloud technologies for optimal database management and deployment.

## Achievements

- **Setting Up the Production Environment**
  
  The first milestone of this project involved setting up the production environment, a task that proved to be quite straightforward given the comprehensive prerequisite information provided. I was able to successfully establish myself on Microsoft Azure, laying the foundational stone for the subsequent phases of this project.

- **Setting Up the Production Environment: Challenges and Successes**

  The task of setting up the production environment marked the most challenging milestone I have encountered throughout the course. Initially, I faced difficulties due to some early mistakes in the project, particularly when these errors began to emerge during this phase. Despite these setbacks, I managed to establish a solid foundation for my cloud-based database system on Azure, beginning with the successful provisioning of a Windows Virtual Machine. Initially, I mistakenly provisioned a Linux VM, which was a significant oversight. Recognizing and rectifying this error was a crucial turning point. Subsequently, I was able to move forward with installing SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), securing the essential tools for effective database management. Furthermore, I successfully restored the database required for the upcoming migration task. Completing this milestone was immensely satisfying, as it represented a significant achievement amidst the challenges posed by the initial missteps that significantly impacted my progress.
